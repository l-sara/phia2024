Creating an R markup script to monitor data collection processes and assess progress in regions, enumeration areas, and teams, and estimate the anticipated completion date of the data collection according to target values.

While this data is semi-cleaned in R, for example, removed duplicates for certain measures, for other measures the team was interested in seeing where there are data issues, such as duplicates, and the Excel sheets created by this script, were used to inform the data cleaning, which ran as a separate activity in parallel with the data collection.

NB this script was developed in a resource- and time-constrained period; some more clean-up and commenting would enable the script to be more easily readable.
